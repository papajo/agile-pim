	Agile PM - Code Review Learnings & SuggestionsThis document tracks
	findings, suggestions, and learnings from the code review of the Agile
	PM application.Initial Analysis (April 22, 2025)Potential Issues &
	Areas for ImprovementSecurity Concern in Project Creation:The
	createProject function in agile-pm/app/projects/actions.ts accepts
	user_id directly from form data [cite: 1]. This is a potential
	security risk.Recommendation: Obtain the user ID reliably from the
	authenticated server session instead of trusting client-side form
	data [cite: 1].Build Configuration Hides Errors:next.config.mjs is set
	to ignore TypeScript and ESLint errors during builds
	(ignoreBuildErrors: true, ignoreDuringBuilds: true) [cite: 2]. This
	can mask underlying problems.Recommendation: Remove these flags and
	fix any reported build errors [cite: 2].Middleware Error Handling:The
	middleware in agile-pm/middleware.ts defaults to allowing requests
	through (NextResponse.next()) even if an error occurs during
	authentication checks [cite: 3].Recommendation: Review error handling
	logic to ensure it fails securely, potentially redirecting or
	returning an error response [cite: 3].Input Validation:Input
	validation relies on basic presence checks (e.g., in
	agile-pm/app/api/tasks/route.ts [cite: 4],
	agile-pm/app/projects/actions.ts [cite: 1]).Recommendation: Implement
	robust schema-based validation (e.g., using Zod, which is a
	dependency [cite: 5]) for API inputs and form data [cite: 4,
	1].Dependency Versioning:package.json uses "latest" for several
	dependencies (Supabase, testing libraries) [cite: 5]. This can lead to
	unexpected breaking changes.Recommendation: Pin dependencies to
	specific versions [cite: 5].Unusual Client-Side Supabase
	Initialization:agile-pm/lib/supabase/client.ts includes a potentially
	unnecessary cooldown mechanism for client creation
	[cite: 6].Recommendation: Investigate the reason for this cooldown
	[cite: 6].Good Practices ObservedTypeScript Usage: Consistent use of
	TypeScript, including generated DB types
	(agile-pm/lib/database.types.ts) [cite: 7].Authentication Checks:
	Server-side endpoints generally check for authenticated sessions
	[cite: 3, 4, 1].Service Layer: Abstraction of database logic into
	service files (agile-pm/services/*) [cite: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].Error
	Handling Structure: Basic try...catch blocks and logging are used
	[cite: 1, 4].Next.js Features: Proper use of API routes, server
	actions, and revalidatePath [cite: 1, 4].Testing Setup: Jest and React
	Testing Library are configured [cite: 13, 14].Implementation Updates
	(April 22, 2025)Based on the initial analysis, the following changes
	were implemented:Project Creation Security Fixed
	(agile-pm/app/projects/actions.ts):Modified createProject server
	action to retrieve the authenticated user's ID from the server
	session (getServerSession) instead of trusting formData.Build Error
	Suppression Removed (agile-pm/next.config.mjs):Commented out
	eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds and typescript.ignoreBuildErrors to ensure
	build-time checks are active. Note: This may reveal existing errors
	that need to be addressed separately.Middleware Error Handling
	Improved (agile-pm/middleware.ts):Refined the main try...catch block
	and error handling for session checks to redirect to the sign-in page
	with an error message, rather than potentially failing open.Input
	Validation Added
	(agile-pm/app/api/tasks/route.ts,
	agile-pm/app/projects/actions.ts):Integrated Zod schemas
	(CreateTaskSchema, UpdateTaskSchema, CreateProjectSchema) to validate
	incoming data in the respective API route handlers and server
	action.Return 400 Bad Request errors with details if validation
	fails.Dependencies Pinned
	(agile-pm/package.json):Replaced "latest" with specific recent
	versions for @supabase/supabase-js and testing libraries
	(@testing-library/*, @jest/globals) to improve build
	stability.Supabase Client Cooldown Removed
	(agile-pm/lib/supabase/client.ts):Removed the custom
	cooldown/rate-limiting logic for client-side Supabase initialization,
	simplifying the singleton pattern. Enhanced the safe fallback client
	(getSupabaseClientSafe) for SSR/error scenarios.Status of Initial
	Recommendations[x] Security Concern in Project Creation: Addressed.
	[x] Build Configuration Hides Errors: Addressed (suppression removed).
	[x] Middleware Error Handling: Addressed.[x] Input Validation:
	Addressed (Zod implemented).[x] Dependency Versioning: Addressed
	(key dependencies pinned).[x] Unusual Client-Side Supabase
	Initialization: Addressed (cooldown removed).
